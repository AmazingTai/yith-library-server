    <h1>Web password manager</h1>
    <p>Yith Library is an online password manager. It will help you to keep 
      your secrets under control in a secure and easy way. Your online data is
      too valuable to avoid protecting it seriously.</p>

      <h3>Using one <strong>password</strong> for everything is a bad idea</h3>
      <p>Today, most Internet services force you to use an username and a
	password as your credentials to identify yourself. Since we are not very
	good at remembering a lot of different passwords, we usually have only one. 
	But what if one of those service's security is compromised and an attacker
	can get the passwords used at that service? Well, that means the
	attacker can access all the services where you use the same password.
	Scary, isn't it?

      <h3 style="margin-top: 34px">Manage your passwords <strong>easily</strong></h3>
      <p>It's not as easy as using the same password for everything but you
	already know you should never do that. The Yith Library is super easy
	to use: just remember your master password is only stored in your
	brain and you should always use the same one. You can access your
	passwords from <a href="${request.route_path('oauth2_clients')}">any device!</a>

      <p>Your passwords are transmitted over the network using the SSL

	their time machine...

      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <ol class="fancy-list">
	<li>When you access the Yith Library the server sends your
	  ciphered password collection to your browser using secure
	  protocols such as SSL. This means that nobody can sniff
	  this traffic and see your ciphered secrets.</li>
	<li>Yith Library asks you for the master password everytime you
	  open an existing password or create a new one. As the
	  browser does not keep the master password in memory, it
	  is safe against malicious programs or plugins.</li>
	<li>After making changes, the data is sent back to the server
	  where it's persisted and it is ready to be fetched from your 
	  other devices. Since it is also stored in your browser cache 
	  you can read them offline.</li>
      </ol>
