Hi ${user.first_name}

We are proud to announce a new feature of Yith Library: periodic email backups directly delivered to your inbox!

With this feature you will receive a copy of your passwords collection in your email once a month. The exact day will depend on the day you created your account at Yith Library.

We have enabled this feature by default but if you don't like it you can disable it in your preferences at ${preferences_link}
