Hi ${user.first_name}

Yith Library sends you your passwords collection just in case something goes wrong with our servers.

You are receiving this email because the preference "Send my passwords to my email monthly" is enabled.

If you don't want to receive these mails anymore you can unset that preference at: ${preferences_link}
